## New App Quickstart

for example we will make an About page:

- Firstly, we would type: python3 manage.py startapp about.
- We will need to Add view code to views.py
- Translate our ERD plan into code in models.py
- Add the model to the admin site in admin.py
- We will also need to create a templates/about directory and an about.html template in there
- Finally, we will need to create a urls.py file and wire up our view with a URL
- When we create our new about app, we will need to do the following:
In the settings.py file, we will need to add 'about' to the INSTALLED_APPS list.
Import our about.urls to the project-level urls.py with a URL  called about/.
We'll need to create an about_url variable in base.html like we did with the home_url, and add a link to the navigation section of base.html.
